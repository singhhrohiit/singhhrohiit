# Hi, I'm Rohit Kumar 👋


<strong>Full Stack Developer • Blockchain Enthusiast • Tech Explorer</strong>

I'm a dedicated Computer Science undergraduate with a passion for full stack development, blockchain technologies (especially Solidity), and system architecture. I thrive on solving complex challenges, building scalable applications, and exploring how technology can enhance everyday experiences.

With experience across both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems, I've developed a range of impactful projects—from decentralized dining platforms to intelligent, IoT-powered traffic management systems. I focus on creating secure, intuitive, and high-performance applications by leveraging tools like React, Node.js, and Web3.js.

I'm particularly drawn to system performance and backend optimization—whether it's building a lightning-fast API or crafting a responsive user interface. With a strong foundation in JavaScript, C++, and smart contract development, I’m constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code.
